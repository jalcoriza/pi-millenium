# pi-millenium
**Raspeberrypi-based** project to replace a broken, expensive and, propietary *Crouzet Millenium PLC* that manages a double heating circuit

<img src = "/doc/images/from_plc_to_rpi.jpg" width = 800>


## Why
My 10 years old *Crouzet Millenium 3 Programmable Logic Controller* broke right in the 2020 fall season's beginning. The technical service told me that it was repairless and the replacement would cost 484â‚¬!
I realized that you don't have any control over the devices you own. Apparently the PLC's problem was SW but not HW although the technical service usually choses the simplest solution for them and normally themore expensive one for the customer

## What
I designed a simple piece of hardware (Rarpberrypi 2 + 4/2 Relays board) that could replace the original PLC's functionality as the project's MVP (Minimum Viable Product) 

The final product will be a compact ESP32-based board that fits in DIN-rail format


## How
### How to use the scripts
1. clone the git project
```
pi$ git clone https://github.com/jalcoriza/pi-millenium.git
```

2. run the main code
```
pi$ python3 millenium
```

3. Commands to interact with the main program
- Normal use

```
pi$ ./set_automate_mode.sh
```

- Basic test

```
pi$ ./test_heater_bedroom.sh
pi$ ./test_heaeter_livingroom..sh
```

- Low-level test

```
pi$ ./turn_on_heater.sh
pi$ ./turn_off_heater.sh

pi$ ./turn_on_v3v_livingroom.sh 
pi$ ./turn_off_v3v_livingroom.sh 

pi$ ./turn_on_v3v_bedroom.sh 
pi$ ./turn_off_v3v_bedroom.sh 

pi$ ./turn_on_pump_livingroom.sh 
pi$ ./turn_off_pump_livingroom.sh 

pi$ ./turn_on_pump_bedroom.sh 
pi$ ./turn_off_pump_bedroom.sh 
```


## Sprint #01 Kanban funcionalities
### to-do
- [ ] dprint() funtion for different levels of logging
- [ ] command for set any state

### doing
- [ ] clean global variables usage

### done
- [x] MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- [x] use integer states
- [x] read thermostate values
- [x] read date
- [x] read single-line commands from command.csv
