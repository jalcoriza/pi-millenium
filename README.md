# pi-millenium
**Raspeberrypi-based** project to replace a broken, expensive and, propietary *Crouzet Millenium PLC* that manages a double heating circuit

<img src = "/doc/images/from_plc_to_rpi.jpg" width = 800>


## Why
My 10 years old *Crouzet Millenium 3* Programmable Logic Controller broke right in the winter seson beginning. The technical service told me that it was repairless and the replacement costed 484â‚¬!
I realized that you don't have any control over the devices you own. Apparently the PLC's problem was sw but not hw but the technical service usually choses the simplest solution for them and normally themore expensive one for the customer

## What


## How

### How to use the scripts
1. clone the git project
```
pi$ git clone https://github.com/jalcoriza/pi-millenium.git
```

2. run the main code
```
pi$ python3 millenium
```

3. Commands to interact with the main program
- Normal use

```
pi$ ./set_automate_mode.sh
```

- Basic test

```
pi$ ./test_heater_bedroom.sh
pi$ ./test_heaeter_livingroom..sh
```

- Low-level test

```
pi$ ./turn_on_heater.sh
pi$ ./turn_off_heater.sh

pi$ ./turn_on_v3v_livingroom.sh 
pi$ ./turn_off_v3v_livingroom.sh 

pi$ ./turn_on_v3v_bedroom.sh 
pi$ ./turn_off_v3v_bedroom.sh 

pi$ ./turn_on_pump_livingroom.sh 
pi$ ./turn_off_pump_livingroom.sh 

pi$ ./turn_on_pump_bedroom.sh 
pi$ ./turn_off_pump_bedroom.sh 
```


### Kanban funcionalities
#### to-do
- [ ] use integer states
- [ ] command for set any state
- [ ] dprint() funtion for different levels of logging

#### doing
- [ ] MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

#### done
- [x] read thermostate values
- [x] read date
- [x] read single-line commands from command.csv
